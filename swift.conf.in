[general]
; buffer_size
; default: 65535
;
; Number of bytes of audio data to buffer from the Swift libraries.
; app_swift will allocate this much buffer space for each concurrent running
; swift app call.
;
; A larger buffer allows the swift lib to generate audio and complete sonner,
; reducing the amount of time we keep the swift port open (consuming a swift
; concurrency license).
; You should tune this based on the lenth of things you're having swift speak,
; how much memory you can afford to burn.
;
; 8192 (8kbytes) is a practical minumum
; You need 8000 bytes to get a second of buffering
buffer_size=65535

; goto_exten
; default: no
;
; When we get DTMF while swift is speaking, we set ${SWIFT_DTMF} channel variable.
; If you would also like the swift application to goto the extension indicated
; by the user's keypress, set this to yes.
goto_exten=no

; voice
; default: Allison-8kHz
;
; Set the voice you want swift to use; If the voice you specify is not found,
; swift will automatically use the default voice it is configured with.
voice=Allison-8kHz
