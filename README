  Synopsis:

        Provides a direct interface into the Cepstral
        text-to-speech engine for Asterisk eliminating
        the need to write audio output files to the 
        filesystem and then stream them back out.

        Also provides multi-digit dtmf recognition with
        a max digits and a wait-for-digit timer very 
        simular to the AGI 'get data' command.


  Requirements: 

        - Asterisk development header files
        - Cepstral Swift Text-to-Speech engine (version 5 or 6)

  Installation: 
                
        - Check that the swift libraries are in your ld path
          * on debian, run: echo -e "\n/opt/swift/lib\n" >> /etc/ld.so.conf && ldconfig
        - On some distributions you made need to copy asterisk.h to /usr/include

        ./configure [options]
        make
        make install (as root)
        make reload (as root)

  Usage:        

        Type "core show application swift" at the Asterisk CLI prompt.

        in extensions.conf:
        exten => s,1,Answer
        exten => s,n,Swift(This is cepstral talking in the default voice from swift.conf)
        exten => s,n,Set(SWIFT_VOICE=Callie-8kHz)
        exten => s,n,Swift(This is cepstral talking in the Callie voice)
        exten => s,n,Swift(Please enter three digits,5000,3)
        exten => s,n,Swift(You entered ${SWIFT_DTMF}.  Goodbye)
        exten => s,n,Hangup
