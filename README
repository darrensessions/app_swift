  Synopsis:

 		Provides a direct interface into the Cepstral
      		text-to-speech engine for Asterisk eliminating
 		the need to write audio output files to the 
                filesystem and then stream them back out.

 		Also provides multi-digit dtmf recognition with
                a max digits and a wait-for-digit timer very 
                simular to the AGI 'get data' command.


  Requirements: 

		- Asterisk development header files
		- Cepstral Swift Text-to-Speech engine

  Installation: 
                
		Check the makefile to be sure paths are correct
		Check that the swift libraries are in your ld path
		On some distributions you made need to copy asterisk.h to /usr/include

                unpack
		make
		make install (as root)

  Usage:	

		Type "core show application swift" at the Asterisk CLI prompt.
